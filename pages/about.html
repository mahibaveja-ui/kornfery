    <p class="text-secondary-bg font-semibold leading-relaxed mb-6 animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
      The story of Smartline Core began with a simple realization—hiring isn’t just about filling roles,
      it’s about weaving people into the fabric of a company’s future. It started with a leader who saw
      the struggles of startups grappling with invisible barriers—hesitant candidates, misaligned fits,
      and the quiet burnout of remote teams. Driven by a deep belief that every hire could spark growth,
      they gathered a small, dedicated crew, fueled by a shared passion to tackle these hidden challenges.
    </p>
    <p class="text-secondary-bg font-semibold leading-relaxed animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-1s">
      The leaders of Smartline Core burn with an unwavering commitment. They pour their energy into
      understanding each candidate’s story, turning uncertainty into opportunity with every call. Late nights
      are spent refining processes, not for profit alone, but to build a legacy where trust and fit redefine
      recruitment. Their enthusiasm lights up team huddles, where every insight into diversity gaps or gig economy
      shifts becomes a chance to innovate.
